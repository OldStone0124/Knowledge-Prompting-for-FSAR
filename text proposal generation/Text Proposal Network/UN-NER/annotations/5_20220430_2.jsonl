{"id": 8776, "data": "hey this time around I want to take a deeper look at a back dive tuck so in about five minutes or less I want to take a close look at some of the important elements of a back dive tuck once your diver starts to do them and do them reasonably well what are we looking for to get them to the next level so let's take a look at this dive has performed at the MLK Swim Center in Silver Spring Maryland and this diver is going to show us a back dive tuck all right so the first thing we notice is this is a pretty good dive I mean this is really not a bad dive at all but let's take a closer look at a couple of areas we're going to start from the beginning what's going on on the take-off then we're gonna let take a look at the position that come out and the lineup and in each one of those we'll have a little bit talked about here first in the take-off the one thing that I noticed first head positioned in the setup her head is a little bit out in front of her body second is hip position you're not gonna there's nothing wrong with her hip position particularly right now but as she starts to move take a closer look at what's going on with her hip position let's look as she starts to rock you see her hips moving out and back a little bit of back and forth and you can tell she's just a little unlocked in that hip joint as she's rocking when that's going on usually what we'll see is a large Pike at the top of the last lift now she's rocking the board she rocks into her into the top before she drops her body weight and lo and behold we have a pike body line right so she's broken her hips out at the top of the lift and for a lot of kids who've done gymnastics before that's a really natural instinct to drop the hips back behind you and so that's gonna put her right into a roll hole her old back handspring memories drop the chest then pull the chest right so what we would love to see right here is hips more under knees bending forward further so her trunk stays upright and then the arm pattern with the arms leading this instead of the shoulders moving back so the shoulders should stay forward arms should get in overhead and then we'd have a little bit better going on with that back takeoff that's a little handspring a little swinging right next let's look at the position in the Tuck almost almost there we want to get those hands down into the middle of her shin and close this gap between her knee her heels and her butt want to get that nice close in so she's got a nice compact tuck position now the kick-out the idea here on the kick-out hopefully is that the diver is going to move everything down and forward in that direction for the initial movement that first movement should be about kicking your legs straightening your hips and knees moving your leaving your chest still as you kick and feeling as though everything is moving back and away in that one direction toward the kick out what you see typically as divers first start to learn the back dive tuck is they want to tip their head back and pull their shoulders back right as they're kicking out and that will end in a bit of an arch as they come out now this diver has a little bit more training and is a little more inside on this it's a pretty controlled kick but you do see a little bit of that pulling away particularly with the hands here those hands should be staying down against the thighs until the hips are all the way open she's in a bit of a rush to get her hands back into alignment now that's the next piece that we want to talk about though too is look at the path that the hands have taken going to the water that's kind of a long way to go around you want to get to here right so we've got a point there and we've got a point here where she's got her hands against her thighs hopefully so she ought to be sliding her hands close to her body with her elbows bent instead of ending with this swing through here right as she brings her hands out this is also going to be even more important when she starts to learn reverse optionals and reverse dives if you don't want a diver swinging their arm straight out like that as they go for the water beautiful job going through the water could use a little more to point if you're going to be really picky but watch that path alright so that's it in the take-off we got a little bit of Swing eNOS watch for stability of trunk and head in position gosh it's almost there but got to grab a little bit lower and squeeze that tuck on the kick everything in the same direction then look back and then move those hands close to the body line as you go for the entry hope that helps see at the pool", "label": [[55, 69, "instance_level_proposal"], [170, 184, "instance_level_proposal"], [916,

{"id": 10821, "data": "elite athletes spend years working to perform the perfect dive on a world stage like the olympics so many hours of grueling repetitive training for a dive that's over in a matter of seconds in those few seconds every single move they make is closely scrutinized by a panel of sharp-eyed judges what if i told you that you too could score a dive like an olympic judge dust those crumbs off your shirt my friend by the end of this video you're going to be a certified armchair expert in diving and if you want to have a go scoring a dive yourself head to our online story the link is in the description okay let's get into it the first thing you'll need to know is the start position good posture is a must the head's got to be in line with the body elbows straight and feet together the next element is the take-off which should be bold high and a safe distance from the board making sure to get enough height to complete the next phase the flight path this dive requires two and a half somersaults in the tuck position so you're looking for the knees to be pulled in close to the chest then we have the entry a diver's body should be vertical as it enters the water so they have enough time to straighten out before hitting the water and making as little splash as possible the best kind of entry is called a rip entry which makes almost no splash at all the worst kind is like you'd expect it's a belly flop and at 10 meters with that surface tension you do not want to be hitting the water like that now you know the basics let's up the stakes and look at a real dive this is nikita haynes a 10 meter platform diver from perth who's making her olympic debut in tokyo she's about to perform a reverse two and a half somersault tuck to make it interesting we've enlisted the help of olympic judge jillian brooker to help score her dive hi i'm jillian and i'm um going to tokyo as the olympic judge for australia and i'm also the ceo of diving new south wales i've been involved in diving for a long time over 30 years okay julian let's take a look at the dive he's got quite a good start position nikita's got some beautiful posture looks fantastic and then i'm looking for a good jump and a good distance from the board as she comes past the board which she had a reasonably good jump i'm looking for a really tight type position and straight away i kind of noticed it wasn't as tight as it could be it was still good but not very good so i've made a slight deduction because i felt her hands were on the towards the upper knees and if she'd held her legs a little bit closer a little bit lower down she could have pulled the tuck in a bit tighter and got a faster rotation so she's left the dive slightly short and she slightly turned her body on the entry so i've made a deduction there's it wasn't quite ripped because it was short she did throw up a bit of splash it was a tiny bit short just a little hollow in a bag so that gives up more more splash so rip entry would be no splash at all they just disappear so your final score um straight away i went seven and a half while i thought it was middle good i didn't think it was a very good dive okay let's have another go we'll show you the same dive but this time from a different diver this is four-time olympian melissa wu she's going to do a reverse two and a half somersault tuck so if you have a look she stands there she's got perfect posture in the beginning she gets a very good jump like her takeoff's nice and high she's a good distance from the platform and and then she squeezes into that tight position like it's it's a beautiful shape that tuck shape she's covered all the she's ticked all the boxes um she times the entry perfectly she's spinning and rotating really quickly and then she just times that entry to perfection and just disappears in the water with very little splash so jillian what's your score for melissa there's not much you could actually deduct for um i would probably give it nine and a half because right at the end and i obviously i don't judge what's underwater but it to me it was just that tiny little bit scoopy at the bottom you're probably starting to get the hang of this so let's mix it up even more this time let's see a completely different dive from a different diver here we have sam fricka who's also making his olympic debut in tokyo he's going to pull off a back arm stand double somersault one and a half twist judging an arm stand dive begins the moment a diver's feet leave the platform one of the hardest things about it is holding that steady balance any sign of a wobble can lead to a deduction it's beautiful he's come up confidently he hasn't hesitated i just would like to have seen him hold that a little bit longer and not wobble as much and when he pushed off he pushed too far out instead of up and he's a little bit loose going through the water there you know he kind of twisted a little bit quickly off the platform too with that arm stand i don't know i quite liked it he's got this presence about him as well so i thought it was still satisfactory and what score did you give sam i think a six or six and a half maybe [Music] there's a lot more to diving than the scoreboard nikita began diving at 13 after years of gymnastics now she's at the olympics nikita what is it about diving that's kept you hooked all these years just the ability of my body to throw myself off of 10 meters and know where i am and spin it's a really interesting feeling and it's like it's really really exciting that i'm one of the few people that can do something like that what do you think about during a dive my coach gives me one cue and it's something that we've focused on in training leading up so we start our training with thinking about a lot of different aspects of your dive and by the end by competition i'm thinking about one thing and one thing only and that kind of just helps me like block out all of that external noise i cover my ears so i don't hear other people's scores and i'm just thinking about that one key thing and so they don't get distracted until i go could you share one of those cues with us for example like through your toes or three and that kind of means a feeling or a thing i'm gonna do with my arms or my feet and if i do that thing then i know that i've kind of done the whole dive correctly what's your favorite moment in a dive is it the anticipation the mid-air spinning or the moment you come up from the water oh that's an interesting question i think my favorite moment is as soon as you've hit the water and you know that you've done a good dive like there's there's it's just an overwhelming feeling of achievement of happiness and even if it's in training or at a competition that feeling is the exact same and i just love that that moment that you know that you've nailed it", "label": [[1041, 1085, "part_level_proposal"], [2488, 2529, "part_level_proposal"],

{"id": 10823, "data": "[Music] welcome to the crown Valley community pool in Laguna Niguel California I'm Kurt Wilson this is Kevin McMahon and we're here with divers from all over Southern California to introduce you to the principles of judging one of the world's most beautiful sports [Music] in competitive diving a full panel of judges consists of either five or seven judges per contest the skills being judged include the approach the take-off the flight which is the elevation and the execution and then the entry into the water the flight can include various combinations of spinning and twisting motions the more complicated the dive the higher the degree of difficulty of that particular dive but we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves this is supposed to be an introduction to judging so before we get into degrees of difficulty and the principles of judging let's start with the basics okay got you Basics in springboard diving there are five different groups of dives forward back reverse inward and twisting diets can be performed in various positions tuck with the diver Bennet both knees and waist during flight and is compact if the position as possible Pike with the diver bending only at the waist while maintaining straight legs straight and free which is used in twisting dives and utilizes a combination of at least two different positions that's enough of an introduction I think let's let the divers take it from here with a front dive in tuk hike and straight the front dive has a forward approach with a half rotation that results in a head first entry into the water now a back dive in touch height and straight next we'll look at reverse dive like front dives reverse dives start with a forward approach but then rotate back towards the board hike and straight the fourth group is inward inward dive start with the divers standing on the end of the board just like a back dive but rotating towards the board here the inward dives in tuck pipe and straight and to finish off our basic dives let's check out some twisting dives twisters can rotate horizontally in any direction forward or backward but also must rotate on the vertical axis so you'll be seeing not only head-over-heels but a rollover effect as well let's check out a couple of basic twisting dives back somersault with a half twist forward somersault with a full twist now let's look at some commonly performed optional dives as you watch the demonstrations remember to look at all of the pieces of the dive the approach the take-off the flight and the entry will run through the same five dive forward somersault tucked forward one-and-a-half somersault tucked forward one-and-a-half somersault hike well we're double tough back somersault touch back somersault straight back one and one half somersault touch reverse somersault tough reverse one and a half somersault tuck reverse one and a half somersault height inward somersault tough inward one or one half somersault cut inward 1 1 half somersault fight forward somersault with two twists free position back somersault with one and a half twists free forward one and one half somersaults one twist free [Music] congratulations you've now completed phase one of United States diving's how to judge clinic you can now identify the groups of dives and have a good idea of what many of the dives commonly done in competition should look like this segment of the video will give you the principles that you as a judge need to apply in awarding a score to a particular dive we'll go over some ground rules and let the diver show you some dives to practice scoring will critique the dives and tell you what scores we think we're appropriate and why the angle with which you see a dive will affect your perception and your score judges are placed on the side of the pool near the end of the diving board where the divers will be performing the dives worry less about whether your score matches ours and focus more on seeing what we're seeing and coming up with a score that falls within a point in either direction of our suggested scores as a judge your responsibility is to judge the dice relative to the contest they're in try to be consistent and allow for your score to accurately Express the differences in the skill you see in each diaper form the other important duty is to disregard the degree of difficulty when scoring a dive apply the same standards to a front double somersault as you would to a forward dive tuck the degree of difficulty component will fairly compensate a diver that successfully completes a more difficult dive when the degree of difficulty or Dede as it is commonly referred to is factored in with the judges awards for the total score of that particular dive how that works is that in a contest with five judges present the highest and lowest scores have been eliminated the remaining three scores have been added together and multiplied by the degree of difficulty to get the total Awards earned on that particular dive in a diving contest each diver is required to do the same number of dives the total award for each divers dive is added together on that divers score sheet to come up with a running total and eventually the final placement of that diver and specific contest if there are seven judges present the highest and lowest scores are still eliminated the remaining five scores are added together and multiplied by the degree of difficulty of that particular dive and then that total is multiplied by 0.6 to come up with the total award for that particular dive all competitive diving is scored on a scale of zero to ten with zero being an incomplete or failed dive and ten a dive performed perfectly theoretically every dive is initially worth a ten and judges deduct points for mistakes and shortcomings in the execution of the diet United States diving's technical rules explained judging standards in detail and you should review that rulebook as a beginning judge you might find it helpful to start by understanding what comprises the satisfactory diet satisfactory with the judges award of five to six is a dive that is balanced controlled and complete before contacting the water with a mostly vertical entry two and a half to four feet from the end of the diving board complete means the diver has performed all the required rotations and or twists before entering the water good to excellent dives should receive scores above six these are dives that are better than satisfactory by demonstrating a strong takeoff a high jump relative to the divers height good body alignment and/or a clean entry into the water the better the dive is performed the higher your score should be deficient dives or dives that fall short of the satisfactory definition faults that usually bring your score down to a four and a half are below include distance too close or too far from the end of the diving board on a sliding scale the greater the deviation from the ideal distance the lower the score a break in position dives have been briefly where they shouldn't piking out when a diver emerges from a tuck by first straightening the legs and then straightening at the waist does not constitute a break in position a split tuck knee should be no further than the shoulder width apart arms above the head on a feet first entry except jumps arms down on a head first entry or extend it out to the side crow hop where the feet leave and then regain contact with the board on a back takeoff and twists when they are too much too little or present and dives that aren't supposed to twist unsatisfactory with awards of two or below include dives that lack a strong takeoff such as dives that stop at the end of the board and fall in or back dives without any press or lift from the board grossly under rotated or over rotated twists as indicated by the judges having a clear view of the front or the back of the diver during the dive or at the entry point into the water lack of a vertical entry dives that fall short or pass the intended stopping point or are still in a tuck or Pike position at the point of contact with the water or when a diver hits the board failed dives receive a zero if the referee doesn't make this call you as a judge may still score the dive as zero if you feel that it was failed let's do an exercise and simulate a meet situation to see how you do with this information for each dive demonstrated you hear the dive number the dive description and a call for scores just as you would in a competition try to commit to a score before you see ours and let's see how you do 101 sea forward dive tuck has a nice take off could be a little bit higher in the dive great tuck and line up 6 and 1/2 101c forward dive tuck a [Music] little bit back from the end of the board on the takeoff and a tiny bit loose in the Tuck arched over on the entry so she went past vertical 4 and 1/2 101 be forward dive Pike good jump from the end of the board needs to be a little bit tighter in the pike and a shade heavy on the entry six 101a forward dive straight [Music] the divers head position is looking at the water right from the take-off and closes early with his arms to check the dive short of vertical six 1:01 a forward dive straight stuck in the forward rotation way short of vertical on the entry for 1:02 see forward somersault tuck a [Music] little bit out

the toes 6 and 1/2 201 a back dive straight to quick into the arm set and the diver pulls way past vertical on the entry 3 201 a back dive straight [Music] [Music] much better control with the dive could jump a little bit higher in the beginning and just a shade over on the entry 6 and 1/2 - Oh to see back somersault tuck needs a higher jump in the beginning and comes out of the rotation way early 2 and 1/2 - OH - a back somersault straight good body set just leaning from the end of the board too far out 4 and 1/2 203 C back 1 and 1/2 somersaults tuck a low jump slow spin and short a

tuck the dive pushes out from the end of the board a little bit past rotation of vertical and a tiny bit of a twist four and one half 3:03 see reverse one-and-one-half somersaults tucker could be a higher jump in the beginning and a tiny bit out from the end of the board six 303 be reverse one and one half somersaults pipe great jump nice rotation on the somersaults just a tiny bit out and a little bit over on the entry five 401 C inward dive tuck could be a higher jump and the body's never straight at the point of entry three and one-half 401 B inward dive Pike [Music] nice jump and pike

{"id": 10824, "data": "the fear of heights is really hard to control especially for people who have never jumped off the platforms before but who is braver today we have two teams who will jump off 3 5 7 and even 10 meters the champions will be established at the end heads up the intensity of the emotions will rise with each high with the fears and pain as well but what will happen on 10 meters watch until the end all stunts are performed either by professionals or under the supervision of professionals this video is intended for informational purposes only don't try anything without a professional advisory hey what's up watercrew my name is jim and i'm a pro cliff diver my friends are youtubers and regular people who try different sports to challenge for the money prize so today is super special contest twin versus boys on a huge platform my friend then a diving coach is going to judge and decide who is the winner and one one very important moment most of you according to the statistics didn't subscribe to the channel and that is very important please do that or maybe you don't want to create the biggest water and fun community ever i don't believe that so pick your team now ready let's fly okay guys today we have to decide who is cooler team guys or team twins everybody is different but they all are starting with a warm-up safety first now to a quick technique lecture our participants need to simply squat and jump no arm swing then they put their arms along their body at the entry that's a kind of a classic straight dive so we can put a mark for it just like at the olympics let's start with 1 meter so our guests can get the idea of what they have to do but it looks like not everyone is going to participate i have never done this i'm not going to well the battle has not even began and it already looks like the girls are winning but now it is more fair two on two so let's meet our brave participants anna is on the board who taught her that nose plugging thing by the way for those who are wondering we have an entire episode on how to not get water in your nose next up is ana sister christina she did an okay jump but it might end up like a disaster of the high platforms should be more vertical now it is the boy's turn demay is going first he is also a candidate for a bruised buttocks on the big heights and the last but not the least participant is mike that is a good one too bad it does not count because only 3 5 7 and 10 meters are going to be counted so 3 out of 4 of our divers have a tendency to land on their peaches hope they change that on the higher boards okay here we are on the three meters boys are going to go first so dima is about to open the first round then gives him six and half points not bad how are you feeling all right be confident i'm cheering for you okay mike is next we'll see if he can do just as well as demon a decent try i have to say although he leaned forward a bit too much and he scores 5 and half points now it's latest time christine is about to go but i sense fear i'm assuming the girls that they won't get injured after jumping off such high the worst that can happen are bruises but this is only three meters what do you do at the entry close my eyes squeeze your glutes all right well christina jumped after all but her try was worser than boys so she only scores 5 points now ana has to do a much better job to keep up with the other team smiling again and she does a great job adding six more points to the team so after the first round guys are one point hat and 5 meters is the platform where you don't want to make any mistakes well let's see who is going to be braver at this high demand is up wait a second 12 seconds later ok go why is it so scary it's much much later after hesitating for a while dimmer didn't show a bright jump rather a very sketchy one this only worth 5 points so this means that now the girls have a chance 5 meters is very different from free eaters ok let's see if mike will be less fearful although he did strange in the air then genuinely grants him with six points and the girls are saying that the hardest part for them is swimming back up after the jump especially when water gets into their noses but let's see what girls will show us at such high anna is going to go first and that was a really great job i have to say possibly the best dive of the day our judge then agrees with me 7 points moreover christina now looks much more motivated this is 5 meters go now go go this is the most dangerous thing don't think about it christina says she's too scared of the hype again now look at me ready yes and she finally did it so proud of christina for overcoming herself she scores five points and just like that the scores are even well we are moving into the next round and here is the 7 meters platform no mistakes are allowed to be made here guys are taking their time before deciding who is going to go first who is up boys mike rock paper scissors one two three it means you are first so demi is actually going to be first hope he remembers the technique let's all wish him good luck mike maybe you go well well well the boys are really scared will somebody jump today or what it was not the greatest jump after all the time spent on the platform mike actually did it but he only scores five and a half points demo has to do a brilliant jump now to get ahead of the girls my entire scalp got flushed with the water are you girls gonna jump for sure yes girls are crazy reckless i have to say i am scared for them what is wrong with me guys this is a real battle for one's respect four different people are here to show us who is stronger today boys or girls somehow all that hesitation and uncertainty has helped demon to do a terrific jump a truly great job that has to be paid off with a high score from the judge seven and a half points nice i hope the girls will show the boys what they got and once again anna is taking her time before the jump this is exactly what i was talking about at the beginning the worst thing happens when you lean back with your shoulders while your feet start flying up i am scared to even think about the 10 meters platform now only 2 points for that and lots of pain i would be surprised if christina didn't get scared after ana's jump i'm trying to cheer her up just like everybody else downstairs but i honestly doubt now if christina is going to jump and i actually told her if she doesn't want to she doesn't have to and go she was so scared so we had to wait nearly 20 minutes before she finally made a decision and probably that was too long so she forgot the technique and she makes the same mistake as her sister although christina's attempt doesn't look as dramatic but believe me this is still really painful and four and a half points from dan well at least twins are definitely leading about bruce's competition after what just happened i cannot let the sisters to go to the 10 meters still they deserve all respect but the boys are totally fine so let's check if they will dare to jump from there ok there is no turning back now after we saw how brave the girls are we decided that the guys must jump to win otherwise the first place goes to the twins especially after those bruises the stakes are really high and the platform is too honestly guys i'm not a fan of daring anybody to jump off the tower so i came up with a different strategy i offered the boys to do a sinker jump i swear it is always less scary to dive if you have somebody by your side ready go pop their sinker is perfect okay they should go for it and they were technically okay from 7 meters so that should be safe hopefully i'm warning everybody that they are ready i quit see you downstairs what great synchro and the boys team is definitely the loser today well what crew do you agree that the twins team is the winner today for more emotions watch the whole playlist with regular people on the
