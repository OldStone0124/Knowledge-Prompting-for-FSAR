{"id": 10831, "data": "I'm going to tell you guys how to do gymnastic tumbling. Now gymnastics tumbling is a part of the floor exercise. All the skills, round off, back handspring, back full, back full twisting, layout, everything that is considered gymnastics tumbling. So I can pretty much just tell you if you are going to try to do gymnastics tumbling, you need to find yourself a safe area. A nice floor exercise is soft, and you need to be doing skills that are in within your own ability and within your own comfort zone. It really just depends on what you are trying to accomplish, what you are trying to learn. A great idea would be to join a local gym. Go in the Yellow Pages and find a local gymnastics club, where you can have a coach and be safe and you can learn how to tumble. There are many different types of gymnastics tumbling, so you need to make sure you're comfortable with doing what you're doing. But there's front tumbling and there's back tumbling. Front tumbling involves the use of a front handspring and back tumbling involves the use of a round off back handspring. Anything where you're running. You're doing a hurdle and doing acrobatic skills is considered gymnastic tumbling. That is how to do gymnastic tumbling.", "label": [[34, 55, "instance_level_proposal"], [130, 139, "instance_level_proposal"], [141, 156, "instance_level_proposal"], [169, 187, "instance_level_proposal"], [310, 332, "instance_level_proposal"], [910, 924, "instance_level_proposal"], [937, 950, "instance_level_proposal"], [987, 1005, "instance_level_proposal"], [952, 966, "instance_level_proposal"], [1010, 1023, "instance_level_proposal"], [1044, 1071, "instance_level_proposal"], [1111, 1125, "instance_level_proposal"], [1202, 1223, "instance_level_proposal"]]}
{"id": 10832, "data": "In United States gymnastics there are levels of gymnastics starting off with level one, moving progressively up to level two and all the way up to level ten. But in order to get to level ten, there are years and years and years of hard work and nonstop determination on getting there. It's going to take roughly 12 years or so to get to the level 10, potentially leading onto collegiate or elite gymnastics. But the work ethic which you must obtain to get to this level is beyond anything, any other sport that you would have to work at. You will need to be here on time. Need to be here every day. You need to give up extracurricular activities in your school. There's not a lot of social life outside of the gym. In order to get to level ten you basically live and breathe in the gym, doing whatever is necessary that your coach asks you to do. And ultimately performing at 100 percent all the time until you've reached your goal.", "label": []}

{"id": 10839, "data": "hey what's happening are you having trouble on your pullover well I'm going to give you some tips and how to's just on the basic steps of the pullover so here is what it is wait we're going to say here's the pullover you can see and this is a great beginner gymnastic skill and it's kind of fun too and it's good for your strength so you want to start on a bar this is a little high if you can find one that's like more chest height that's gonna be your best bet and some kids like to start really far back like this and they'll even argue with me and go no no it works better I'm like now oh really you're making it harder for yourself okay about this this close to the bar this is great you don't want to be too far under so I get some about like a half a foot while the Sun is blending so here nice you're gonna step with your bad leg because then you're gonna kick your favourite leg up and over and then your other legs gonna join it for lunch so I'm a righty so I'm going to step with my left foot then I'm gonna bend this left leg not too much you want to bend it so that you can push as you kick cause if you step with a straight leg look it pushed no your right leg is really gonna kick as you're kicking you push with that left leg at the same time just switch it up if you're a lefty Cart Muller switch your legs and step with your right foot keep your left foot over your arms are going to be bent usually in gymnastics at Zoe's Street pencil arms but for your pullover you're gonna start with your arms bent and your chin is gonna be above the bar not on the bar some kids will go like this and you're gonna kill your chin so chin above the bar as your foot kicks up it's gonna get to about here say this is the bar it's gonna get to oh well why don't I just use the bar dude it's gonna get to about here and that's when your other leg is gonna come together like it's right about here it's almost vertical and the other foot comes and joins it now as your legs are going up over the bar look for your feet please put on some really awesome nail polish and just say wow look at my nail polish my toes look great so I see him then once your toes get over when you get to here you have to continue your feet going down please down down down down down Sam kind of pipes it's like if you threw a t-shirt over a clothing line the t-shirt would kind of go blue you know like it would drape over or your folded in half like a taco or something so I've seen be they're going down down then my hand switch to the top of the bar at the very end and I pull my chest up and then once you get here you can be nice and tight ribs in push down on that bar don't don't land and go look I did it cuz then you know you're gonna you're just gonna make it a little more sloppy at the end when you land be like you squeeze and you want to stay here with your shoulders for it at the end there's a lot of kids will do their pullover and there though arch and lean back and then I go oh and I like really get nervous so because I totally could've fallen and don't let go of the bar if I would have done that and let go of the bar Oh bad news so that's basically the pullover so the key things you need you is bent arms chin above the bar push really hard off your push your leg kick hard with your kicker length watch your feet as they go up and over and once they get over think hips to the bar oh that's really important you guys because a lot of kids and then it's gonna be really really difficult and don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away remember practice makes perfect I can't so I think I told you this before if I practice more maybe I'll be able to sell my button on instead of super glowing you just gotta work at it like everything in life I mean there's so many things I want to do but I got practice first don't switch your hands to the top of the bar until right at the end your chest is going up then you switch because this is another thing I see some kids will switch their hands to do and they'll do that and they'll try and lick their chest up with your feet still up like this so say I just pulled over I'm going over so remember you're supposed to get your toes down right now well instead of doing that they keep their feet here and they try and come up like that and they switch their hands early and they stick their head back like a goose or something like that I almost really did de-spawn Yanks you could fall on your hands and break your arms and your wrists I don't mean to scare you but we do not want that to happen so my suggestion is to practice on a really low bar with mats underneath have a spa have lots of mats always around you at the beginning get something to stand on put something big underneath the bar return like this bar is lowered and stilts you hike [Music] when you're here you can just fold your hips over the mark with your feet touching something down below and then slowly go forward but remember right here I'm gonna have to drop fold in half and switch my hands over and you can practice rotating your hands back in or it's like a motorcycle Oh motorcyclists are so fun and then you can practice pulling up so your toes are gonna go down and then test em I do not suggest doing that by yourself for the first time have someone push your feet down then come up and also to help you out you can put a block or something like that in front of the bar if the bar simplify step your back foot upon here some member I'm a righty curve in there man and then use this to help out because it's gonna give you a little bit of a boost that's how a lot of my students will you know finally get to the finish line great have a pullover party once you'd finally make it you can do it and as you're going over nice tight legs and pointed toes are key because then it's gonna look more like spectacular pissed off one with cross legs and I mean it okay folks I think we covered everything if I forgot something I'll upload my old pullover video and maybe there's something in there that'll help you out that I forgot to say in here thank you for watching and if you want to learn any other gymnastic skills

shirt let's go oh no okay so you gotta help me find everyone else um don't give me any hints though because you probably know where they're at but g uh first eliminated first one i thought i honestly

{"id": 10847, "data": "[Music] okay so this lesson is all about gymnastics floor skills so we're going to be looking at the skills that we do on the floor lots of our fundamental gymnastic skills okay now the first thing i'm going to ask you to do is to stand up in your lines okay now you can see children that there's a gap in our line so we're going to run and then we're going to travel across the gap now i want you to imagine that there's a river flowing through here now in this river there's some piranhas that like to nibble on toes it's really stinky this river so if you put your feet in it's going to smell forever okay all right so we want to leap over that gap okay however you like and then we're going to walk back on the floor so that the next person can have a go now you can have your go okay so you can go across this gap okay but the next person needs to wait until you've come off the map before they can start but we do want to keep busy okay right children off you go get busy let's get across this gap good keep going very nice fantastic okay frieza now i think this is too easy for you so i'm going to make the gap a little bit bigger okay so if you could all help me please make this gap a little bit bigger that would be fantastic wonderful all right okay now can you help me children how are we getting across this gap i want you to imagine i've never done it before and you're going to help me with how we're going to get across the gap so can you tell me what you're doing to manage to get across without getting your feet in yes yeah so you're gonna need some good speed now i'm not seeing you jumping i'm seeing you doing something else does anyone know the name of what we're doing yes we're leaping so what's the difference between a leap and a jump children yes oh can you show me again here come a bit closer to me ah so that's a leap show me a jump okay so children what's the difference between the two uh yes please that's right okay but what about if i do this so what's the difference between what i just did and that yep they are giving me more power but you just showed me something my legs are they're straight and they're far away so they're apart aren't they so when i'm doing a leap i take off one foot and i bring my legs nice and far apart and i land on the other foot okay so that's the difference isn't it between our jumps and our leaps so i jumps i've got two feet together and i land with two feet together my leap i'm taking off one foot i'm making those legs nice and far apart and i'm leaping onto the other foot okay now how am i going to get further how am i going to get further yes yeah have a bit more run which will give us a bit more power won't it to get further across this gap what do you think we should be doing with our arms to make them really nice these leaps yes well i think when i'm running i want them like this what about when i'm leaping what else should we have a look let's have a go let's get busy let's see you cry can't you let's have a little experiment with what works with your arms okay off you go get busy good take off one foot land on the other well done i'd like to see a little bit more speed from you very nice okay freeze where you are okay get back to your lines quickly i don't know your name but could you come to the front for me please yep please i liked what you did with your arms go to the beginning of your mat okay let's have a look what she does with her arms let's see oh i felt like her lip her lip went higher it lifted up what did she do with her arms showed me all of you where did her arms go okay so we need to lift those arms up to get some lift into these leaves okay let's keep going with these leaps off you go lift those arms up okay freeze you can stay exactly where you are what could we do now to make our legs look more gymnastic what could we do yes please point our toes and something with our legs yes yes so we want our legs nice and straight and our toes pointed so let's think about that arms lifted legs straight toes pointed off you go get busy oh good i'm liking these straight legs very nice here okay right line up please does anyone think they can make a different shape when they go across does anyone think they could make a different shape when they go across so they're still leaping oh what do you think you could do you could do it on the side so you could run along okay when you get to the gap you could leap sideways oh let's give that a try right off you go children leaping sideways oh i like it very good good try really nice good still got to take off one foot very nice and land on the other very good very nice okay go and line up right i've got a shape for you now where you are on your floor i'd like you to have a little go at this shape so what we're going to do now is we're going to bend our front leg and we're going to keep our back leg nice and straight so on the floor where you are let's have a little go so our front leg is bent and our back leg is nice and straight and we've still got those arms lifted because we know don't we that if we lift our arms up it makes our leaps higher okay so you've got to think about it so let's stand up for a minute so your front leg is the one that's bent so let's lift that one up can you point your toe good and then your back leg can you lift it behind you it's straight straight behind you oh right this is really tricky to think about which leg does what okay so you need to really really think about it okay it doesn't matter if you get this wrong okay it's all a bit of fun okay and we're learning we get we learn more from things wrong than we do from doing things right because we can always change what we're doing don't we okay right off you go have a go these are called stag leaves good oh good try very nice oh very good can you point your back foot okay line up for me please right i'm gonna have a look at this line here okay we're going to watch them and then we're going to see if we can learn anything stand up nice and smartly please i'm going to see if we can learn anything from watching them right off you go oh very good oh i like it very good good [Music] very nice right did anybody spot somebody that's really making that stag shape oh did you spot somebody okay would you like to show us yours again okay so come to the front can you tell me what you liked about hers so she kept her front leg bent and her back leg was nice and straight and pointed well let's have a look and see if we can see that okay pressure's on it's going to be good oh very nice yes i agree so she's got that lovely stag shape in the air hasn't she um i wonder do you think you could go for me please because yours was really nice as well now i want you to watch this one and i want to see whether or not we can help her make hers even better oh i like her she didn't do it that time okay uh let's have a look at yours please oh okay so i really like that one but we could definitely help her okay so which of her legs was bent which of her legs was bent what do you think her back one which one should be spent the front one so have another go before you go let's just have a little think about it so could you bring the one that comes up first up and bend it just stand where you are and bend it oh now can you put the other one behind you and stretch it okay so that's what you've got to think about in the air it doesn't matter if you don't get this right okay just try your best [Music] oh good try so which one are you bending you're bending that one aren't you okay which one's coming up first that one so could you have a little go bending that one for me good and then point the other one behind you okay so go back to the beginning so which knee is going to come up first that one right have another go oh very good so now she's got the front leg bent and the back leg bent so she needs to work on getting that back leg straight now there's lots of you doing the same thing not quite getting the right legs bent and straight so let's all have another go and let's see if we can make some improvements lovely demonstrating that group thank you very much right keep going off you go which leg have you got to bend which one's got to be straight or think about your back leg being a straight oh very nice very good very nice so which leg are you gonna bend okay and which one's gonna be straight behind you so which one have you got to lift up first that's right okay right stop there we're going to change our leap again right so now class i need your help to make the gap much smaller so we're gonna have a little gap like this please so if you could help me tidy your mats up please and make the gap smaller okay and then line up nice and smartly again please oh let's be quick let's line up nice and smartly okay now as we go over this gap we're going to have a go at doing what's called a scissor kick oh now it's still a leap because i'm taking off one foot and i'm still landing on the other now when my legs straight all bent what do you think they were straight weren't they and i tried to point my toes they might not be perfect but i tried to point them now in a scissor kick we kick one leg up and then the other one before we land okay now the easy thing to do here is to fall onto our bottoms because we lean back a little bit when we're doing this so you've got to be careful where should our arms be in our leaps can you all show me please oh yeah that's right so our arms above our shoulders now we don't want drooping leaps like this because my arms are below my shoulders we want them above our shoulders right let's get busy off you go with these nice scissor kicks very good very nice can you get those arms out wonderful lovely i like it very smart leaps here very strong strong young men very nice oh i like it do you think you can kick those feet up come here come to me come to me stand next to me right watch one than the other that's it right off you go now you've got to think about it very nice very good like it do you think you can try and stretch your feet so at the moment your feet are like this okay so now we've got to try and point them forward so point them point them okay okay so you need to be mindful of that don't you yes okay so do your best i like it lovely high legs i think i can see some good kickers in this class children that are good at kicking the ball definitely okay right listen carefully now you've got to be sensible now because i would like you to go and sit with a partner now when you choose your partner i don't want you to choose your best friend i want you to choose somebody that you can work sensibly with so think about that so you can see now i've split the mats up into two okay so that you can sit with your partner on a mat please okay go and find somewhere to sit please boys can i move your map that way a little bit please i'm sure you'll be able to find someone not everybody's got a partner yet okay sit down on your mat nice and smartly please okay let's make sure that you can see me okay wonderful right i need your help do any of you know any gymnastic roles oh now listen before you put your hand up do you know the name of the role and can you demonstrate it okay oh yes please i'd love your help a forward roll do you think you could come off the mat for a minute please okay so could you just sit down for a second i'd love to see your forward roll okay i really liked it could you go back to the beginning for me please stand at the beginning of your mat now how can we make this role even better has anyone got any tips for her any hints for her yes please she could try and do a bit faster so we need to think about that i wonder right now how she stood oh could you sit smartly on your mat please i wonder if we could make her smarter right now before she's even started yes please yep could you stretch your arms up nice and tall for me please good right now could you face forwards on your mat with your arms stretched up tall right now um i noticed that she put one foot in front of the other when she did her roll has anyone got any advice about that sit up smartly please yes yeah okay so you want both feet at the same time so um some of you are just learning your forward rolls and if you are just learning your forward rolls it's good to have your feet slightly apart so stand back up again for me so rather than having them right together let's have them slightly apart now you're going to stretch up nice and tall and you're going to put those hands down hands onto the floor right by your feet now what's she got to do with her head so if she's going to do the perfect forward roll she's got to do something to make sure that her head and neck's safe tuck your head right in so tuck that head right in roll over off you go now stop now how's she going to get up like a gymnast okay what do you think excellent so you're going to stand up and then what about the end what would you like her to do at the end stretch up tall so could you go again from the beginning okay so think about all those things we said how are you going to start very nice and how are you going to finish oh i like it okay now you're working in pairs i've just listened to you all you're all really good coaches you've all given me lots of advice i want you to help your partner see if you can help them make their forward rolls nice and smart please okay take turns okay let's see how your forward rolls go if anybody needs any help with their forward rolls i'm more than happy to come and see you so what was your advice for her she did she used her hands when she stood up so you're gonna have another go and listen to what your coach has just said so reach forwards fantastic great bit of advice well done what's your advice do you think hers is pretty good so how we could maybe make yours a bit harder by you stepping back from the mat and now you've got to reach into it oh very nice okay your turn now so what was the advice that your friend gave you [Music] good advice i like your advice [Music] well done yeah your advice worked didn't it that's really good i like how you pushed on your feet to get you over okay really good okay sit down smartly for me please i need a new gymnastic role so i need someone else to help me give me some advice oh yes please oh i think that one's really really tricky we're going to leave that for the time being we might come back to that in a minute can you think of another one oh yes please can i ask you to move over here for a minute please could you show us your teddy bear roll can we remember gymnastic we're going to sit smartly just wait for a second wonderful i love how you're sat now right okay so you're going to show us your teddy bear roll very good right could you just sit facing me in your straddle shape okay come a little bit closer okay right we need some hints and tips for this for this roll because not all of us are going to know how to do it what's our advice okay now i'm looking at her shape now and i'm thinking i wonder how she could make her legs and her feet a bit nicer do you think you could help me could you help me what could she do with her legs and her feet to make them a bit nicer she could i quite like them wide i'm having a look at her feet what could she do with her feet point them can you point those toes lovely right now when she does this shape she's going to hold on tight to those legs okay so can you hold on tight now what's she going to do next what's she going to do next anyone got any ideas oh let's have somebody different can you help me have you got any idea what she's going to do how is she going to do that teddy bear role so sit up for a minute you know what you've got to do but you've got to see if you can think about telling us ah does she lean back right if you lean back lean back lean back onto your back bring those feet up with you because you've got to hold on to them has you got anywhere to roll no she hasn't had she really she could only sort of roll over that way or maybe that way but she needs to she needs to turn all the way around so sit back up again sit back up again so rather than rolling onto her back what could she roll onto elbow yeah her elbow or her side so the first thing you do children is roll onto your elbow or your side okay and then she rolls onto her back doesn't she roll onto her back and then she goes on to the other side so there's a pattern here isn't there so the pattern is shoulder back shoulder she goes shoulder then onto her back then onto her shoulder now the reason we sometimes get into trouble with this sit up for me please okay is we tip over onto our side and then we forget to look up at the ceiling and we roll onto our tummies when you're rolling over you've got to look up at the ceiling have your tummy button up towards the ceiling and roll round okay right this one's tricky but help each other off you go so what happened here okay right so let's try again do you know one little hint i'd say to you as well so go back to your starting shape face that way so you've got some matte behind you face that way [Music] the other thing i'd say to you as well is try and keep this shape so come around here a little bit more right now hold on to this shape so what did you say she's got to look up at the ceiling more so tip over look up at the ceiling okay so now you've got the shape better try again try again shoulder back shoulder go and go on us your advice helped didn't it right swap over see if you can help her how are we getting on boys terrible well that's good we can make lots of progress from terrible can't we so hold on to that straddle shape just wait a minute let's see if we can help him and then we'll see if we can help you okay so what's the first thing that needs to go on the floor yeah so shoulder needs to go on the floor oh where's your straddle shape gone hold on to your legs now he's got to look up at the ceiling yes and then what's he got to do next yep and then you've got to sit back up legs wide very good right your turn you'll tend to swap come a bit further forwards right can you stretch these feet oh yes this one this one's not so good at stretching is it oh very nice look at that right which part of his body goes on the floor first yep that part so shoulder bring your leg with you and then where's his tummy got to go up towards the ceiling or down towards the floor oh oh if he goes up okay up towards the ceiling and round you go have another little go have another little go sit down stay where you are see where you are shoulder oh shoulder back shoulder tip over shoulder back shoulder good okay sit down smartly with your partner please are you sitting smartly your gymnastics is really impressing me make sure you're smart in between okay right i need another roll now another nice and easy roll a nice simple roll for us oh can you think of one yes please that's not a roll is it we will do those in a minute though okay uh can you think of another role for me i'm thinking of a role that's very long can you think of one oh i've got some people helping you do you know how to do it okay right sit up smartly please oh would you like to help me with your pencil roll okay so let's ask your partner please could you just come off your mat for a minute please right could you show us your pencil roll oh i like it this is fab okay right now i'd like you to come back to the beginning here and just lie down here for me please right stop for a minute how can we help him improve his pencil role i think there's lots of improvements to be made sit up smartly please okay what do you think we could do he was you're right okay so i like what he's doing with his arms now as well do you agree and i think he'll find it much easier to roll with those arms up there so off we go let's roll i like it very nice right i'd like you to come back to the beginning of the mat here now come a little bit further up now lie down flat now we're gymnasts now so we are going to challenge ourselves to make this role more gymnastic now the challenge for you is to not let your hands so stretch your arms up here get your chin up a little bit and can you lift your feet up as well or keep them straight now we're going to try and roll without letting our feet or our hands go on the floor oh pick them up pick them up oh tricky oh i like it come back to here again i'm back to here again i think he did a pretty good job then so let's see do his hands and his feet touch the floor we don't want them to oh off you go off you go keep them off keep them off keep them off right come here for me a minute and just sit down on your bottom it's that hard no oh he finds it easy now it should be quite tricky because we're using our tummy muscles here and our backs a lot to keep our arms oh sit back down please okay we're using our tummy muscles to keep our backs sorry we're using our tummy muscles and our backs to keep our feet and our hands off the floor okay now your job when you're watching is to see if your partners can keep those feet and those hands off the floor and ideally your heads and your elbows okay we want all of those off of the floor right off you go [Music] what could we say about her legs what do you think you could say right should we get her to have another go and see if she can take your advice okay you might need to move back a bit so she can get her legs straight let's see if you can get your legs straight oh head off head off head off that's it head up head up oh i like your advice it really worked didn't it let's see yours [Applause] oh can you get those arms up [Applause] get those arms up oh off you go arms up above your head feet up yes yes yes yes yes really nice sit down smartly please right i've got another roll for you okay um may i ask you to move off your mat and i'm going to use this young lady right do you think you could kneel down like me please okay and you're gonna curl up into a ball does anyone know the gymnastic name of the shape that she's in right now oh just wait a minute we've got some hands that we could put up in the air it's not the roll it's the name of the shape she's making right now you need to stop shouting out and use your hand yes yes yep it's the tuck shape so this roll we make this lovely tuck shape and we use this tuck shape for our forward roll earlier as well didn't we okay now i'm going to ask you to roll all the way across that way and then land back on your knees keep going oh stop fantastic can you come back towards me now we're going to make this role more gymnastic can you just have a little look at me for a minute you're going to lift one leg to the side like me good so you're going to go like this then you're going to curl up into a ball and you're going to roll over and then bring the other leg out to the sides to top tall okay and roll back towards me oh i like it right should we all have where we are where we're sat now she will have a little go at the shape now i've noticed that it's her outside leg that goes out so the one where she's rolling is the bent one okay right have a go with your partners help each other [Music] his arms it's really tricky isn't it leg out to the side oh the other one the other one so that one stretch your arms that's it all now come into your tuck shape oh and stood up tall oh i like that did you oh it's brilliant fantastic now you said you couldn't do that what have you learned there you can so if you try then then sometimes you're better than you think okay sit down nice and smartly for me please right [Music] okay who in here can do a cartwheel okay right okay so you're all good pairings then that's good okay right uh pop your hands down for me please okay uh let's use someone different did you say both of you can do cartwheels okay let's have a look at you two so when you're doing your cartwheels you need to make sure that you're not close to each other why is that what do you think you might kick each other okay so we're gonna have a little go at our cartwheel okay now this looks really tricky to me you have a go now i'm not sure i can do that so i might need to learn from the beginning so we're going to have a look at this cartwheel and we're going to see how they do it and then we're going to see how we can learn it from the very beginning because we can't always all do it exactly like that so could you go again for me please now could you start facing me now i've noticed that she starts facing me but her hands don't end up facing me they don't end up pointing towards me i want you to watch her hands so off you go ah so she was facing this way but which way were her hands pointing can anyone help me yes they were pointing the opposite way weren't they so you have a go now start facing me now let's have a watch just move out the way so they can see which way her hands go yeah so her hands are pointing that way so that's the first thing that we can learn sit down for a minute please girls okay i'm just going to get a rope okay so uh you two boys over here can't do cartwheels can you okay okay excellent i'd like you to both come off your mats please um in fact i'm going to ask you to come on to this match please okay now i'm going to put a rope out for you boys okay and i've got my rope in a little semi-circle okay so i'm going to ask you to stand the side of your semicircle okay now you're just going to come off a minute otherwise you'll get kicked okay now if you're facing towards the stage towards that way which way should your hands go what have we just learned from watch watching these so do they go the same way or do they go the opposite way okay so we must learn that can you please sit up can you two please sit up okay right okay so your hands are gonna go down here okay so just stop there for a second and then your feet you're gonna jump them over to this side i like it okay now stand up for me please oh good try now before you start over here i'm going to ask you to make a nice star shape okay so just watch me a minute i don't kick you so move off a minute so your hands go the opposite way and then you jump your feet across and then i'm going to ask you to make that star shape again do you think you could have a go good can you make that star shape for me tricky and make that star shape good your turn oh i like it stand up tall okay so those of you that can do cartwheels you're going to practice them how could we make our hands our cartwheels harder for those of you that can do it really well yes [Music] or you could you could make your cartwheel smaller any other ideas yes you could try and do it one-handed how about if we were a bit daring maybe we could go over our partner maybe they could lie down and we could go over them okay right so those of you that can do cartwheels i want you to make your cartwheels more challenging if you're doing it with one hand maybe you could go with the first hand or maybe you could go with a second hand okay if you're just learning cartwheels i want you to go and get yourself a rope and i want you to do exactly what these boys are doing okay off you go please may i move your mat that way a little bit so i'm a bit worried you're going to collide girls can i move your mats that way a little bit please [Music] you two girls can you move your maps that way please boys i'm genuinely if you're matt that way slightly so start facing that way stand behind the rope behind the rope where's this big star shape have you got your legs wide now which way your hand's going to go that's right so hands down that way good boy now the challenge for you is can you get your feet behind the rope on this side as well okay have another go come over here good your turn i liked your star at the end it was very good of course i can you've got [Music] good boy like it can you stand up tall at the end to make a star towards me well done good girls make sure your mats are safe put them together i like this this is lovely good right i saw your knee go down you've got to try and keep that knee off the floor you two boys we need to put our mats together no you need to watch each other you need two maps and you also you also need to help each other each other let me take that one for you have a go [Music] right i'm i'm not seeing a semi circle if i was to put a line down here what shape would it look like a square so we need it to be a bit a little bit rounder how's that boys right star shape oh good hands round good try i like it right your turn legs wide legs wide good yeah hands pointing towards your friend and jump your feet over towards me yes good boy that was really good effort finished with a star shape at the end [Music] [Applause] oh so good okay so it's this first leg here that you've got

a go have a go [Applause] oh i like that you've got your legs together at the top i was thinking that maybe your partner could lie down in a different shape and you could go over it so could you think of a shape to do on the floor you could you could try see if the star works [Music] oh i like it i wonder if you stay there stay there i wonder if you could go over the legs somehow could you do that
